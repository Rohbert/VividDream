About:
This hack is a mix of standard and Kaizo level design. 3 Levels. Level 1 being standard, 2 and 3 being much harder Kaizo style levels. 
This hack was spun off from the SMB2U LDC hosted by SMW Central. I was so inspired by all the levels submitted that I expanded my level and made a 1 world hack. 
Search youtube for Super Mario Bros. 2 Vivid Dream Walkthrough if you need a hint on completing a section or 2. Good luck! 
You may use any character for level 1. Levels 2/3 require Mario.  Unlimited lives enabled.
